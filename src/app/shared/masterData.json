        "info": "Every business exists to create value for its customers and for itself. The value provided by a business can be summarised in its ‘value design.’ Having astrong, clearly defined value proposition, together with detailing out how this value proposition will be executed, is essential to attracting customers. In its simplest terms,  value design is a positioning approach that describes for whom you do what uniquely well. It describes your target buyer, the problem you solve, how you solve that problem, how you deliver the solution, and why you’re distinctly better than the alternatives.",

Functional Jobs: are specific things customers need to get done, such as tending to the garden or buying groceries. <br/>2. Social Jobs: are the things customers want to do in order to impress others, such as buying a trendy dress or wowing their boss with an amazing presentation.",

There's a lot more that goes into the psychology of deciding to buy something than just weighing the price. <br/> Marketing strategists have noticed this and noticed that it's not always easy (but always super important) to assess how your customers are perceiving value. For the longest time, marketers have focused all their efforts only in analysing and managing the price side of the buying process as the only solution to boost profits. However, recent studies show that when a customer is evaluating a product to purchase, its perceived value plays one of the most important roles in this process. <br/> Understanding the true value of a product is extremely complicated due to its psychological and highly personal nature. Basically the amount of value in a particular product lies solely in the eye of the beholder. Yet research shows that there are functional and emotional elements that are associate with a product’s value. <br/> Although it’s hard to pin down value, when done correctly it can be a cornerstone of successful marketing. So it’s important to try to understand which elements form the core value of your product in order to improve it and stand out from the competition. <br/> Source: Adapted & modified from 'The Elements Of Value'. by, Eric Almquist, John Senior, & Nicolas Bloch, Bain & Co., Harvard Business Review, September 2016",

They use cognitive frameworks they possess to “connect the dots” between changes in technology, demographics, markets, government policies, and other factors. The patterns they then perceive in these events or trends suggest ideas for new products or services - ideas that can potentially serve as the basis for new ventures.  <br/> This pattern  recognition perspective on opportunity identification helps integrate into one basic framework three key factors that have a solid bearing on opportunity recognition.  <br/> 1. First, engaging in an active search for opportunities; alertness to them; and prior knowledge of an industry or market. it also helps explain interrelations between these factors.  <br/> 2. Second, a pattern recognition perspective helps explain why some persons, but not others, identify specific opportunities. <br/> 3. Third, a pattern recognition framework suggests specific ways in which current or would-be entrepreneurs can be trained to be better at recognising opportunities. <br/> But what are those  patterns? How can you design opportunity? Create it? Execute on it? And make it stick? Put simply, how can you design where you must play and how you must play? <br/> Source: Adapted & modified from 'Better and Faster: The Proven Path to Unstoppable Ideas', by Jeremy Gutsche, 2015",

You can mix, do product integration, do social integration, or bringing people together, or add value through immersive experiences, and co-branding. <br/> - Starbuck coffee + cookies + free wireless - confluence of products and services that create immersive customer experience. <br/> - Nike Sportswear - Nike Sports-band and Nike+iPod - convergence of GPS navigation and athletic wear made it possible for people to track their cardio and workouts. <br/> The confluence pattern can be disruptive - it can spawn an entire industry by itself. Caution: Don't rush into it - examine your market, industry, competition, and your intrinsic capabilities and competencies. <br/> You must 'design' the offering - not just add or put together two or more things for the sake of achieving confluence.  Remember the following core principles <br/> 1. Chaos & adversity creates opportunity. Let it awaken the innovator in you. It is during times of distress that some of the best ideas convert into solid opportunities. <br/> 2. Align and work hand-in-hand with relevant business, technology, social and economic trends. This will help you multiply your odds of success. <br/> 3. Old becomes new. New becomes status-quo, status-quo becomes old, a new emerges. This cycle continues - you cannot wish this away.  It is likely that tomorrow has its foundations in yesterday! Lean into the past, and borrow from it - and create unique and memorable offerings. <br/> 4. Organisations tend to get embroiled in the daily rhythm, and sometimes moe forward with blinders on. This approach does not help you to examine opportunities that might exist in the periphery or edge of your vision. The fringe of your business. Seek your fringe, drive a set of people within your organisation to only examine and explore what can be innovated at the edge of your enterprise. You will see that what you don’t see can inspire amazing ideas that can lead to disruptive opportunities. <br/> 5. Sometimes opportunities lie in combining two or more completely disparate ideas to create a wholesome offering. The ability to look outside of your frame of reference, and explore potential ideas can lead to great ideas and opportunities, and lead you to create something that is unexpected, surprising and holds customer interest.

                "info": "This pattern emerges when you craft products or services that breaks away from the main stream. Create an offering that is different from the beaten path, and create value and a new experience for customers from rebellion. <br/> We, as people, are tuned to focus more on what is different, rather than what is mainstream. Differentiation and surprise are two emotional hooks that can cause disruption. With the advent of social media, the shifts in cultural influences etc., the markets are a ready breeding ground for break free ideas. Individualism is more highly prized than uniformity. If employed effectively, this pattern can disrupt major industries/companies.  <br/> Break free ideas tend to create a niche, and self-market themselves. Certain customer groups are excited about differentiated products - the first movers. And this can propel the brand into turbo mode. Caution: The road to break free thinking is more often than not met with hesitation and fear - a feeling of jumping into the unknown. You will face a lot of resistance as well - since different thinking is not common place.  <br/> Ex: Diesel Jeans - A jean  is a jean is a jean. Yet, Diesel pivoted itself as a brand that diverges from mainstream by introducing jean concepts that were unheard of - miners jeans, torn jeans, fabric innovations etc., and Diesel took an entire industry by storm. Brands that have been present for decades like Levis and Lee could not bring themselves to innovate like Diesel. The result - Diesel jeans were priced almost 4 times that of competition if not more! They broke free from main stream by creating a cult, by leveraging the halo effect, creating exclusive Diesel club memberships, and ensuring that their brand was positioned as a fashion statement and not 'just another jean company'. Remember the following core principles: <br/> - If you intend to do something that is “popular”, then know that there is no surprise element. It’s already being done - which is why its popular. Deviating from popular is to do something different from mainstream. So do something unique, cool, and with pizzaz. That can be your next big thing! <br/> - Spend time to understand what’s the common/mainstream thinking in the marketplace. What is your competition doing? What are players in the “edge” of your market doing? Go against the grain. Rebel.  <br/> - Ex: The latest Old Spice marketing campaigns - different, rebellious and unforgettable. Red Bull ads. - Shockvertising - Danger marketing.  <br/> - You cannot b e all things to all people. Stop trying to service all your customer segments. You will never be remembered - as you will be only one in a crowd. Instead, discover the specific group of customers you want to cater to - and become totally and completely irresistible to them. Stoke deep emotion, create hooks that will drive brand loyalty in spades.  <br/> - Every product has certain weaknesses. And your competition will make sure to latch on to it and drive home the usefulness of their product as against yours. Rather than succumb to it, shift the focus. Make your weakness your strength and make it the focal point - craft messaging around it. Become different. Tell your consumers why your weakness doesn’t really matter.  <br/> - Ex: Red Bull - the taste of the drink is not very palatable - but yet, the company took that weakness and crafted campaigns around it - catapulting sales of Red Bull worldwide. Weakness is merely a perception - it is how you deal with it that counts. ",
